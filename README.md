# TDSProj-1
This repository is for people from Zurich who have atleast 50 followers.

1. Process of Scraping:
   The data was scraped using GitHub API, focusing on people of Zurich having followers more than 50.
   
   First a personal access TOKEN had to be generated from github, which was used to access the necessary data related to the given conditions (People from Zurich with atleast 50 followers)
   After going through various iterations, the data was collected and stored in csv files, which were downloaded by me to do the questions assigned, using python.
   
2. Interesting Fact:
   I found that Python was the most common language among various developers, while JavaScript was the second. This was surprising as people a few decades earlier were more invested in languages like C, C++, Java etc. And now, these basic Languages have a decling popularity, while Python, a relatively new language, is so popular among the new generation.

3. Suggestion for new developers:
   Since Python is becoming universally accepted and popular, it is recommended that the new developers have a strong command on the language.
   Also, as we see, the popular languages keep changing over time, relating to the need on the people, so it is recommended that developers keep in touch with what new languages are arising, and their uses, so that when the need arises, they have basic knowledge about it.
