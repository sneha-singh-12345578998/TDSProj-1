This repository is for people from Zurich who have atleast 50 followers.

1. Process of Scraping:
   The data was scraped using GitHub API, focusing on people of Zurich having followers more than 50.
   
   First a personal access TOKEN had to be generated from github, which was used to access the necessary data related to the given conditions (People from Zurich with atleast 50 followers)
   After going through various iterations, the data was collected and stored in csv files, which were downloaded by me to do the questions assigned, using python.
